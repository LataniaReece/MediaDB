# MediaDB App

[Full Site](https://mediadb.netlify.app/). A responsive streaming app using the third-party API “themoviedb” for movie and TV data. 

Developed with React + TypeScript using Context API for favorites management. Select components are also backed by robust unit tests.

# What I Learned

In this app, my primary aim was to use a third-party API (https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs) and build a typical streaming app design. For this straightforward app, I chose Context API over Redux for state management. While reacquainting myself with this approach, I appreciated the out-of-the-box features that the Context API offered, finding it much simpler than Redux.

I also intentionally included TypeScript in my toolkit as I wanted to use this as an opportunity to enhance those skills. Similarly, I explored unit tests with vitest and @testing-library/react. While the initial configuration was a bit challenging, I successfully navigated through it. Consequently, I have established a reusable template that can be applied in other apps.
